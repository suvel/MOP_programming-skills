### Stories, and finding things to automate

#### Story 1, Smart LED

I work from my home. I get up at 7am and turn on my light, after 10 am when the sun light peaks into my room I turn off the light to save electricity. Afternoon at 1 pm I have lunch, usually a heavy one. I turn-on the light again so that I don't sleep while I am working. I turn it again off at 12 while going to bed.

I noticed that there is pattern of my doing the same task of turning on and off the light , so I bought a Smart bulb(Philips smart-wifi LED) and created a routine to by mention the time rage and how I want it behave on the specific time.

I was using a App that available in the market , but Philips also have document which you go through to control the LED through a program.
