### Introduction

Hello üëã. I am Suvel , I am a Sr. Software Engineer at a Hyderabad based SAS company.

I have been hooked to programming from my 11th grade, always felt programming to be entertainment and creative process. I have created small games and management system software for leisure. After 2 year of my professional career I started look my skills as tool that not just solves companies problem but my own as well.

In this article I am going introduce you to how you can think like a programmer and what sought of problem you can solve with the same.
 
    ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt having fun, you are doing it wrong. If you feel like getting up in the morning to work on your business is a chore, then it's time to try something else.‚Äù ‚Äï Richard Branson

### Stories, and finding things to automate

#### Story 1, Smart LED

I work from my home. I get up at 7am and turn on my light, after 10 am when the sun light peaks into my room I turn off the light to save electricity. Afternoon at 1 pm I have lunch, usually a heavy one. I turn-on the light again so that I don't sleep while I am working. I turn it again off at 12 while going to bed.

I noticed that there is pattern of my doing the same task of turning on and off the light , so I bought a Smart bulb(Philips smart-wifi LED) and created a routine to by mention the time rage and how I want it behave on the specific time.

I was using a App that available in the market , but Philips also have document which you go through to control the LED through a program.

#### Story 2, Legacy Grocery Store

Imagine you are son/daughter of a old couple who manages a medium sized grocery shop in a middle of a town. In recent time the customer retentions of the shop has been decreasing significantly. After investigating you came to know your parent due to old age where  unable to removed expired packages from stock and were giving out the same to customer.

So you decide to help in this scenario by developing a application , where they can enter the product name and expiration date while stocking up and on a daily bases this application will notify you and parent to remove products that are expired for that day. Though this your customer retention rate be back to normal.

#### Story 3, Go green

Your fried want to have small garden in her home, so she start with a small plant and trying to take care of it in order to learn about maintain plants. But she often over or under water the plant, causing the plant to dry or die due to same.

Here you volunteer to help her. You do some research and find out about moisture sensor. This moisture sensor will give out number representing the moisture content in the soli it is kept in, and this can connect with a microprocessor like Adrino to control a LED to turn RED when the optimal moisture number is reached. So after deploying this system your friend will not wanter the plant if the LED is RED, this will help her save plants and get I idea on different vegetation and it water pulling capacities.


**All this above mention scenarios can be entry level projects by it self.**

### Creative programming inspiration

Creative programming allows programmers to express themselves creatively, combining art and technology in new and exciting ways.

People and videos that inspired me:

1. [Daniel Shiffman,  Codeland - Creative Coding: An art and code showcase - NYC 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68JUaszsvmU&t=562s) 

    Daniel Shiffman is a Associate Arts Professor, New York University and also a youtuber. In this video he takes us though different art project that his students made with incorporating programming to make do stuff or interact with the human.

2. [Mariko Kosaka,Knitting.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Cc1vrvjdY&t=828s)


    Mariko Kosaka, Web Developer Relations team at Google. In this video she talk about how she you used a programable machine to knitt image by providing it to the system as input, thought javascript.

### Creative programming Free tools

1. [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

    Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

1. [Sonic PI](https://sonic-pi.net/)

    Sonic Pi works on simple loops of code. You enter a few commands that indicate beats, melodies, and samples to play. These commands are processed through a synthesizer backend called SuperCollider. The essence of it is loop and repeat, but if you change the code during the performance, the music changes too. It‚Äôs a simple and powerful way to get anyone up and running with electronic music or basic programming concepts.

### Tools with easy learning curve

1. [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

    The key benefit of notebooks is the ability to include commentary with your code. That means that you can avoid the error-prone process of copying and pasting analysis results into a separate report. Instead, you simply mix your analysis with the report text in the notebook.

2. [App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/)

    The web interface consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) very similar to Scratch and StarLogo, allowing users to drag-and-drop visual objects to create an application that can be tested on Android and iOS devices and compiled to run as an Android app.
