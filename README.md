### Introduction

Hello üëã. I am Suvel, a Senior Software Engineer at a Hyderabad-based SAS company.

I have been hooked on programming since my 11th grade and have always found it to be an entertaining and creative process. I have created small games and management system software for leisure. After two years of my professional career, I started looking at my skills not just as tools to solve company problems but also my own.

In this article, I am going to introduce you to how you can think like a programmer and what sort of problems you can solve with those skills.

### Stories, and finding things to automate

#### Story 1, Smart LED

I work from home. I get up at 7 am and turn on my light. Around 10 am, when sunlight fills my room, I turn off the light to save electricity. At 1 pm, after a heavy lunch, I turn on the light again to stay awake while working. Finally, I turn it off at 12 midnight before going to bed.

I noticed a pattern in these tasks of turning the light on and off, so I bought a Smart bulb (Philips Smart WiFi LED) and created a routine to specify the time range and behavior of the light at specific times.

Initially, I used an app available in the market, but Philips also provides documentation that guides you on controlling the LED through a program.

#### Story 2, Legacy Grocery Store

Imagine you are the son or daughter of an elderly couple who manage a medium-sized grocery shop in the middle of town. Recently, the shop's customer retention has been declining significantly. Upon investigation, you discover that your parents, due to their old age, have been unable to remove expired products from the stock and have inadvertently sold them to customers.

To address this issue, you decide to develop an application. This app allows them to enter the product name and expiration date during stocking, and on a daily basis, it notifies both you and your parents to remove products that have expired that day. Through this initiative, you aim to restore the shop's customer retention rate.

#### Story 3, Go green

Your friend wants to have a small garden at home and starts with a small plant to learn about plant care. However, she often overwaters or underwater the plant, leading to its drying or death.

To assist her, you volunteer to help. After researching, you discover a moisture sensor that provides a numerical value representing the soil moisture. This sensor can be connected to a microprocessor like Arduino to control an LED, turning it red when the soil moisture reaches an optimal level. By implementing this system, your friend will know not to water the plant when the LED is red, thus preventing plant damage and gaining insight into the watering needs of different plants.


**All this above mention scenarios can be entry level projects by it self.**

### Creative programming inspiration

Creative programming allows programmers to express themselves creatively, combining art and technology in new and exciting ways.

People and videos that inspired me:

1. [Daniel Shiffman,  Codeland - Creative Coding: An art and code showcase - NYC 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68JUaszsvmU&t=562s) 

    Daniel Shiffman is a Associate Arts Professor, New York University and also a youtuber. In this video he takes us though different art project that his students made with incorporating programming to make do stuff or interact with the human.

2. [Mariko Kosaka,Knitting.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Cc1vrvjdY&t=828s)


    Mariko Kosaka, Web Developer Relations team at Google. In this video she talk about how she you used a programable machine to knitt image by providing it to the system as input, thought javascript.

### Creative programming Free tools

1. [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

    Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

    (EXAMPLE)[https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/three-js-table-ysjkqx?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js]

1. [Sonic PI](https://sonic-pi.net/)

    Sonic Pi works on simple loops of code. You enter a few commands that indicate beats, melodies, and samples to play. These commands are processed through a synthesizer backend called SuperCollider. The essence of it is loop and repeat, but if you change the code during the performance, the music changes too. It‚Äôs a simple and powerful way to get anyone up and running with electronic music or basic programming concepts.

### Tools with easy learning curve

1. [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

    The key benefit of notebooks is the ability to include commentary with your code. That means that you can avoid the error-prone process of copying and pasting analysis results into a separate report. Instead, you simply mix your analysis with the report text in the notebook.

2. [App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/)

    The web interface consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) very similar to Scratch and StarLogo, allowing users to drag-and-drop visual objects to create an application that can be tested on Android and iOS devices and compiled to run as an Android app.
